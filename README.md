# Querying_and_Merging_Wine_Data_SQL
Contains code that takes grape varietals and merges in the type of wine (red, white, red blend, sparkling, etc.). Some of the data attributes are derived via text characteristics and others are by a straight varietal type pair. Includes sub-queries, case statements, and other standard SQL type actions.
